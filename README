This is a small introduction to the [b]ero*fix User[A]ppFS [f]ramework (baf).


= Prerequisites for using baf =

 * x86- or x86_64 PC running Linux
 * installed build tools (package build-essential on Debian/Ubuntu)
 * Python 2.6.0 or newer


= Installing baf =

After extracting the archive or cloning the repository, switch to the directory
and type 'make install'. By default this will install baf to '/usr/local',
so you need to be root for the installation or use 'sudo'.

If you want to install baf to another directory, append 'PREFIX=/some/path'.
So if you'd like to have it installed inside your home-directory, type:

   make install PREFIX=~/some/path

The baf-script will be installed in '~/some/path/bin', so make sure this
directory is listed in your $PATH-environment variable!


= Creating a first UserApp =

To create an UserApp, just type:

   baf create an_app

This will create a directory structure and some files needed to create an
UserApp in the subdirectory 'an_app'.

= Modules =
A bero*fix UserApp can contain several modules, which help you to manage the
different components of your application.


== Creating a module ==

Switch to the directory mentioned above and type:

   baf module create a_module

This will create the skeleton for a module in the 'modules/' directory
called 'a_module'.

If you switch to the directory 'modules/a_module', you will see a few
directories, a Makefile and an empty file called 'mod_files.lst'.

The Makefile is set up to configure, compile and install applications that lie
in the subdirectories of 'src/'. It is very basic, so it should be adjusted to
the needs of the application you want to use. If your program has a configure
script, you will have to add parameters to the 'CONF_OPTS' variable in this
file and maybe adjust the 'MAKE_OPTS' and 'INST_OPTS' variables as well.
The goal should be, that your application installs itself in
'an_app/modules/a_module/'.

The file 'mod_files.lst' should list the files to be installed in your UserApp.
E.g. if the build-process of an application creates the following files:

 * a_module
  * bin
   * a_bin
  * libs
   * a_lib.so
   * b_lib.so

you should add the following lines to this modules' 'mod_files.lst':

   bin/a_bin=bin/a_bin
   lib/a_lib.so=lib/a_lib.so
   lib/b_lib.so=lib/b_lib.so

All files listed here will be installed, all files not listed ignored.
So you should check that you listed all files needed by your application.


If you want to run an application as service, you might want to add an
init-script to the init-subdirectory of your module. In the directory
'a_module/init' is already a simple example, the file 'S00example'.

Copy or rename it, but keep the scheme S[0-9]{2}[a-zA-Z]{*}. Edit it to the
needs of your UserApp and keep in mind:
The path on bero*fix will be '/userapp/an_app/'!

If you want the init-script to be installed, please remember to add it
to your 'mod_files.lst'!


== En-/Disabling a module ==

Modules are enabled by default, if you want to disable a module
(it won't be compiled or installed) or re-enable it, you can do this with the
following commands.

To disable a module, type 'baf module disable a_module' while in root of
your UserApp.

To enable a module, type 'baf module enable a_module' while in root of
your UserApp.


== Compiling a module ==
To compile a module, type 'baf module compile a_module' while in root of
your UserApp.


== Deleting a module ==
To delete a module, type 'baf module delete a_module' while in root of
your UserApp.


= Creating an UserAppFS package =

After you've configured your modules, you can create a package that contains
all modules.

To create a package switch to the root-directory of your UserApp-Repository
and type:

   baf make

This will compile and install all enabled modules, ask you to modify the file
'pkginfo/VERSION' and create a tar.gz-archive in the directory 'pkg/'.


= the baf configuration file =

The root of an baf application-directory-structure contains a file named
'.baf.conf'.

Currently, this file only contains the path to the toolchain and the editor
used, which is set to vim by default. If you want to use another editor,
like SciTE or kWrite, just replace to path to vim with the path to your
favorite editor.
